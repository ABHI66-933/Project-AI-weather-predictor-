SKYCAST AI EVALUATION REPORT
Generated: 2026-02-23

MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
1. Temperature Regressor: LSTM (32 units) + Dense(1)
2. Weather Classifier: Dense(16) + Dense(8) + Softmax(5)

REGRESSION METRICS (Temperature):
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.25°C
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 1.52°C
- R² Score: 0.88

CLASSIFICATION METRICS (Weather Label):
- Accuracy: 85.4%
- Precision: 82.1%
- Recall: 84.5%
- F1-Score: 0.83

CONFUSION MATRIX SUMMARY:
- Clear: High recall, low false positives.
- Rain/Storm: Occasional confusion between high precipitation states.
- Cloudy: Moderate precision, often confused with Clear in transition periods.

CONCLUSION:
The LSTM model shows strong temporal awareness for temperature trends. The classifier performs reliably across primary weather states, though performance could be improved with more granular precipitation data.
